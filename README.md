# How to add a license to a repository

1. In the root directory of the repository, create a new file named `LICENSE`
2. Copy a license to `LICENSE`
3. Create a commit and push to remote

**NOTE:** Look in the [summary](https://github.com/9623-Warp-Drive/license/blob/master/summary) directory to see the TL;DR version for each license

# Optional
run `install.sh` to add a license to the current working directory

# Todo
- [x] Mutiple license selection capability
